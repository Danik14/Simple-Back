# Web Application built with Go and its standard “http” library for sharing snippets with other users.

### I managed to build this application after reading “Let’s Go!” book by Alex Edwards.
This app has:
- working PostgreSQL database connection
- authorization process
- dynamic html templates
- TLS certificate
- basic custom configuration and security.
